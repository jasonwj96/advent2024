//! # Infinite Elves and Infinite Houses
//!
//! The amount of presents that each house receives in part one is 10 times the
//! [divisor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function) `σ`.
//! For example the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, so house 6 receives
//! 10 + 20 + 30 + 60 = 120 presents.
//!
//! It's highly likely that the answer will be a
//! [superabundant number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superabundant_number) but there's no way
//! to easily *prove* that so we brute force check every possible solution. The approach is similar
//! to a reverse [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes),
//! iterating first over each elf, then over each house adding the presents.
//! Somewhat unintuitively the `ln(x)` asymptotic complexity of this approach is much lower
//! than the `n√n` complexity of finding the factors of each number.
//!
//! To speed things up we make one high level optimization and a few low tweaks.
//!
//! The high level optimization is an observation from user `warbaque` on the
//! [Day 20 solution thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/3xjpp2/day_20_solutions/)
//! that [Robin's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisor_function#Growth_rate)
//! shows that the `σ(n)` function is lower than `eᵞ * n * ln(ln(n))` for all `n` greater than 5040.
//! This means that we can determine a starting index close to the final result, skipping over a
//! huge chunk of numbers.
//!
//! The low level tweaks reduce the amount of work that needs to be done.
//! We break the search range into fixed size blocks from `start` to `end`,
//! for example 200000 to 299999 with a block size of 100000. Then we can make some observations:
//!
//! * Elf 1 visits each house once.
//! * Elves from `start` to `end` each visit a different house exactly once,
//!   bringing start, start + 1, ... presents.
//! * Elves from `end / 2` to `start` skip over all the houses.
//! * Elves from `block size` to `end / 2` visit *at most* one house as the increment is
//!   greater than the size of the block.
//! * Elves from `2` to `block size` may visit any number of times.

// More explicit syntax fits in with surrounding code better.
