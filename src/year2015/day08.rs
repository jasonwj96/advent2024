//! While [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) may feel like a
//! natural choice, it's much faster and easier to simply treat the input as a stream of raw
//! ASCII `u8` bytes including newlines.
//!
//! For part one we run a small state machine using [`fold`] to keep track of the current and
//! previous characters. If we encounter a hexadecimal escape then four characters become one so the
//! difference increases by three. The sequences `\\` and `\"` both increase the difference by one.
//! Each newline increases the difference by two since every line is enclosed with two quotes.
//!
//! Part two is even more straightforward with no need for statekeeping. Quotes and backslashes
//! need to be escaped so increase the difference by one. As before each newline increases by the
//! difference by two.
