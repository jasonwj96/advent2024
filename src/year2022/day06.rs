//! # Tuning Trouble
//!
//! One solution to this problem is to use the [`windows`] method to slide over groups of the desired
//! size, then construct a [`HashSet`] from the characters. If the [`HashSet`] is the same size
//! as the window then we know that all characters are unique, as sets contain no duplicate elements.
//!
//! We'll use a faster approach that minimizes the work needed. Instead of creating a set for each
//! window, we'll maintain the last position seen of each character. As we advance character by
//! character we lookup the previous position. If this is within the packet size, then we advance
//! the start of the packet to exclude that character. Once the packet has reached the desired
//! size then we return the current index.
//!
//! [`windows`]: slice::windows
//! [`HashSet`]: std::collections::HashSet
