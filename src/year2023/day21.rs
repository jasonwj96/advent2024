//! # Step Counter
//!
//! This solution uses a geometric approach. Looking at the input data reveals several crucial
//! insights:
//!
//! * The sample data is a decoy and will not work with this solution.
//! * The real input data has two special properties:
//!     * Vertical and horizontal "roads" run from the center.
//!     * The edge of the input is completely free of obstructions.
//!
//! These properties mean that we can always cross a tile in exactly 131 steps. We start in the
//! middle of a tile and need 65 steps to reach the edge. Part two asks how many plots can be
//! reached in 26501365 steps.
//!
//! ```none
//!     26501365 => 65 + 131 * n => n = 202300
//! ```
//!
//! The number of tiles that we can reach forms a rough diamond 202300 tiles wide.
//! For example `n = 2` looks like:
//!
//! ```none
//!       #
//!      ###
//!     #####
//!      ###
//!       #
//! ```
//!
//! The next insight is that if we can reach a plot in `x` steps the we can also reach it in
//! `x + 2, x + 4...` steps by repeatedly stepping back and forth 1 tile. This means the
//! number of tiles reachable depends on the *parity* of a plot from the center,
//! i.e. whether it is an odd or even number of steps. As the 131 width of the tile is an odd
//! number of plots, the number of plots reachable flips from odd to even each time we cross a
//! whole tile. There are `n²` even plots and `(n + 1)²` odd plots in the diamond.
//!
//! ```none
//!       O
//!      OEO
//!     OEOEO
//!      OEO
//!       O
//! ```
//!
//! Lastly, we can only partially reach some tiles on the edges. Solid triangles represent corners
//! that can be reached and hollow triangle represents corners that are too far away.
//!
//! ```none
//!          ┌--┐
//!          |◸◹|
//!         ◢|  |◣
//!       ┌--┼--┼--┐

//! ```
//!
//! The total area is adjusted by:
//! * Adding `n` extra even corners
//!     ```none
//!         ◤◥
//!         ◣◢
//!     ```
//! * Subtracting `n + 1` odd corners
//!     ```none
//!         ◸◹
//!         ◺◿
//!     ```
//!
//! To find the values for the total number of odd, even plots and the unreachable odd corners
//! we BFS from the center tile, counting odd and even plots separately. Any plots more than
//! 65 steps from the center will be unreachable at the edges of the diamond.
//!
//! One nuance is that to always correctly find the extra reachable even corner plots requires a
//! *second* BFS starting from the corners and working inwards. All tiles within 64 steps are
//! reachable at the edges of the diamond. For some inputs this happens to be the same as the number
//! of tiles greater than 65 steps from the center by coincidence, however this is not guaranteed so
//! a second BFS is more reliable solution.
