//! # Reactor Reboot
//!
//! The key to solving this problem efficiently is the
//! [inclusion-exclusion principle ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion%E2%80%93exclusion_principle).
//!
//! Looking at a two dimensional example
//! ```none
//!    ┌──────────────┐A            Volume of A: 144
//!    │              │             Volume of B: 66
//!    │ ┌─────────┐B │             Volume of C: 18
//!    │ │         │  │
//!    │ │ ┌────┐C │  │
//!    │ │ │    │  │  │
//!    │ │ └────┘  │  │
//!    │ └─────────┘  │
//!    └──────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! Using the inclusion-exclusion principle the remaining size of A is:
//!
//! 144 (initial size) - 66 (overlap with B) - 18 (overlap with C) + 18
//! (overlap between B and C) = 78
//!
//! If there were any triple overlaps we would subtract those, add quadruple, and so on until
//! there are no more overlaps remaining.
//!
//! The complexity of this approach depends on how many cubes overlap. In my input most
//! cubes overlapped with zero others, a few with one and rarely with more than one.
