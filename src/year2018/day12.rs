//! # Subterranean Sustainability
//!
//! The problem is a one dimensional version of
//! [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
//!
//! The trick for part two is that the plants will eventually stabilize into a repeating pattern
//! that expands by the same amount each generation. Once 2 deltas between 3 subsequent
//! generations are the same we extrapolate 50 billion generations into the future.
