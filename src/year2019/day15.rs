//! # Oxygen System
//!
//! [Breadth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) is the simplest
//! path finding algorithm and is suitable when the cost of moving between locations is identical.
//! [This excellent blog](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)
//! has more detail on the various path finding algorithms that come in handy during Advent of Code.
//!
//! The tricky part is determining the shape of the maze. If we assume the maze consists only of
//! corridors of width one and has no loops or rooms, then we can use the simple
//! [wall follower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze-solving_algorithm#Wall_follower)
//! algorithm to eventually trace our way through the entire maze back to the starting point.
