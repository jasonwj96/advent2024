//! # Springdroid Adventure
//!
//! Jumps are always 4 tiles wide landing on `D`. If needed we can jump again immediately
//! landing on `H`.
//!
//! ## Part One
//!
//! We jump if any of `A`, `B` or `C` are holes and there is ground where we will land at `D`.
//! This take 7 instructions:
//!
//! `J = (NOT A OR NOT B OR NOT C) AND D`
//!
//! Using [De Morgan's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws) we can simplify
//! to 5 instructions:
//!
//! `J = NOT (A AND B AND C) AND D`
//!
//! ## Part Two
//!
//! We add two rules, either `H` needs to be ground so that we double jump immediately or `E`
//! needs to be ground, so that we can wait and not jump too early.
