//! # Monster Messages
//!
//! Parsing the input has some nuances. Rust doesn't like recursive structs without indirection,
//! so for non-leaf rules we keep the rule number in order to lazily lookup the rule in a `vec`
//! later. This also handles parsing the rules in any order, as a rule may refer to another that
//! has not been parsed yet.
//!
//! My input created 2²¹ or 2097152 total valid matching sequences so trying to generate all
//! possibilities up front is much slower.
//!
//! ## Part One
//!
//! The `check` function implements a recursive matcher. If a rule is a prefix of the message
//! then the function returns `Some(index)` where `index` is the first character *after* the
//! matching pattern, in order to allow matching to continue with the next rule.
//! If there is no match then the function return `None`. For example:
//!
//! | Rule   | Message   | Result    |
//! | ------ | --------- | --------- |
//! | `aaaa` | `aaaab`   | `Some(4)` |
//! | `aa`   | `aaaab`   | `Some(2)` |
//! | `bb`   | `aaaab`   | `None`    |
//!
//! As rule 0 must match the *entire* message with no characters left over, we count only messages
//! with a result of `Some(len)` where `len` is the length of the complete message.
//!
//! ## Part Two
//!
//! First we do some detective work analyzing the new rules. Rule 8 is:
//! ```none
//!     8: 42 | 42 8
//! ```
//! This matches one or more repeated rule `42`s (in regex format this would be something like `42+`).
//!
//! Rule 11 is:
//! ```none
//!     11: 42 31 | 42 11 31
//! ```
//! This matches one or more nested pairs of rule 42 and 31, for example `42 31` or `42 42 31 31`.
//!
//! Assuming rule 0 is the same for all inputs:
//! ```none
//!     0: 8 11
//! ```
//! gives a pattern that matches:
//! 1. A sequence of two or more rule `42`
//! 2. Followed by a sequence of one or more rule `31`
//! 3. As long as the number of `42` matches are at least one greater than the number of `31` matches.
//!
//! For example `42 42 31` or `42 42 42 31` or `42 42 42 31 31` matches but *not* `42 42 31 31`.
//!
//! Since we don't need to handle the general input case (a common pattern in Advent of Code) we can
//! implement this rule directly in code.
